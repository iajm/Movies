                    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                    <p>Young Carl Fredricksen watches a film about his hero, Charles Muntz, and meets Ellie, who shares his love for exploration. They eventually marry, but financial obligations prevent their dream trip to South America. Ellie passes away, leaving Carl a recluse. He lifts his house with balloons to fulfill their dream, unintentionally taking a young scout, Russell, along.

                      They end up in South America and meet a bird named Kevin, as well as Dug, a talking dog. <br><br> They encounter Muntz, who has gone mad searching for Kevin. After a series of adventures, they rescue Kevin from Muntz, but Carl's house is lost.
                      
                      Carl discovers Ellie's adventure book, with a note encouraging him to have new adventures. He rescues Russell from Muntz's zeppelin and defeats Muntz. They return Kevin to her chicks and attend Russell's ceremony. The story ends with Carl and Russell sitting together by the falls, the house in its intended spot. </p>
