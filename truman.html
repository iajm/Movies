                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                <p>Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is an insurance salesman living an ordinary life on Seahaven Island, but there's a catch â€“ his entire life is a TV show, and he doesn't know it. The town is a massive set enclosed under a dome, and the show's director, Christof (Ed Harris), has been recording Truman since birth. Things start to change when Truman notices odd occurrences and becomes increasingly curious about the world beyond Seahaven.

                  Truman's journey to discover the truth involves a chance meeting with a woman named Sylvia, who tries to reveal the reality of his life. Suspicion grows as Truman begins to notice that the people and events around him seem scripted. He embarks on a quest to escape Seahaven and uncover the truth.<br><br>
                  
                  As Truman's escape efforts intensify, Christof attempts to stop him, controlling the environment to maintain the illusion. In the end, Truman confronts Christof, chooses to leave his artificial world, and exits through a door at the edge of the set, leaving the show behind and surprising the world.
                  
                  The film ends with Christof's realization that Truman has chosen freedom, and he cuts the transmission, concluding the lifelong reality show.
