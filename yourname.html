                    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                    <p>The film opens with comets streaking across the sky, and we meet two teenagers, Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu, who start switching bodies in their dreams. They learn to communicate and set ground rules for this unusual situation. Both teenagers experience life in each other's bodies, leading to some amusing and awkward moments. Mitsuha, who lives in a small town, dreams of escaping to Tokyo, while Taki, who lives in Tokyo, enjoys his time in Mitsuha's body and even sets him up on a date with Ms. Okudera. However, the body-swapping eventually stops, leaving both of them feeling a sense of loss.
                    Taki becomes determined to find Mitsuha and her town after learning about a tragic comet impact. He, Ms. Okudera, and Tsukasa embark on a journey to locate the town, discovering that it was destroyed three years ago. Meanwhile, Mitsuha, unaware of the disaster, attempts to save her town with the help of her friends.
                    <br><br>During the comet's impact, both Taki and Mitsuha fail to meet in person. Taki loses his memories of Mitsuha and the town, while Mitsuha tries to recall his name but only finds "I LOVE YOU" written on her hand.
                    Five years later, Taki, now a young architect, is searching for something or someone he can't remember. He crosses paths with various characters who were saved by the events he and Mitsuha set in motion. Finally, Taki and Mitsuha spot each other in a bustling city, feeling a deep connection and recognizing each other.
                    As they approach each other, they ask if they can inquire about each other's names, hinting at a reunion filled with love and shared memories.
                    The film concludes with the promise of a heartfelt reunion between Taki and Mitsuha. </p>
