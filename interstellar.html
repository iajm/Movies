                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                <p>In a future Earth devastated by crop blight, former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is now a farmer. Humanity's last hope is to find new habitable planets through a wormhole near Saturn. Cooper and his daughter Murph discover coded messages from an unknown intelligence directing them to a secret NASA mission led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine). Earth is running out of time as crops fail, and Plan A to save humanity has failed. Plan B involves sending embryos to start anew.

                  Cooper joins a space mission with Amelia (Anne Hathaway) to explore potentially habitable planets. <br><br>They first visit Miller's planet, but it's time-dilated, causing 23 years to pass on Earth. Murph grows up and works to solve the gravity equation to launch space stations. On the mission, they find that Mann (Matt Damon) faked his data. Romilly dies, and Cooper and Amelia journey towards Edmunds' planet to continue Plan B.
                  
                  While nearly out of fuel, Cooper and Amelia slingshot around a black hole, where time becomes a spatial dimension. Cooper encodes data into Murph's watch and discovers an extra-dimensional "tesseract" where he can communicate with her. Cooper helps Murph solve the gravity equation, and she evacuates Earth.
                  
                  Cooper reunites with the elderly Murph, who led humanity's exodus. He sets out to find Amelia and CASE, who are on their way to Edmunds' planet to begin Plan B.
